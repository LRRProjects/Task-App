# Task-App
Created a server for a task tracking application that uses REST API. The application allows for the creation, reading, updating and
deleting of user and task. The user password data is encrypted using the bcrypt module before being inserted
into the MongoDB database, and the user is verified using JSON web tokens. The server allows for the upload of images.
